# CS 425 - Assignment 5

## Problem Statement

Implement the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm that was taught in the
lectures. Given the input images [`square256.raw`](./in/square256.raw) and
[`car.raw`](./in/car.raw), generate the spectra of each as greyscale images.

## Developing

Developed in C++ and compiled using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

To build and run the program, use the following command:

```shell
make && ./build/out
```

Program outputs in `.raw` format are available under
[`./assets/out/raw/`](./assets/out/raw).

Screenshots of program outputs in `.png` format are available under
[`./assets/out/screenshots/`](./assets/out/screenshots).
